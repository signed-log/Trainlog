"""Render a trip as a PNG card: its route on the site's own map, ready for Discord.

The map is not redrawn here — it is rendered by MapLibre Native, from the same
`dark-train` style the site serves to browsers, by a Martin tile server:

    POST /style/{id}/static/{bbox}/{w}x{h}@2x.png

with the route as a GeoJSON overlay in the body. So the card looks like the
map on the site (labels, shields, the Rhine) and follows the style if it is
ever restyled, without a headless browser anywhere. Dark, because Discord
defaults to dark mode.

Martin needs `styles: {rendering: true}` and the style registered as a source;
set `martin.url` and `martin.style` in config.yaml to point at it. With either
missing, render_trip_card returns None and the announcement simply goes out
without a picture.

The style file Martin is given must be a *resolved* copy: the one in the repo
carries the {{mapPinUrl}} placeholder that vector_style() fills in per request,
and Martin fetches the sprite itself, so it needs a real URL in the file.

Rendering is Linux-only in Martin, uncached and non-concurrent, which suits the
handful of announcements an hour this makes — it is not for request handlers.
