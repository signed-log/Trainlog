"""Post a user's trips to Discord as they depart.

Several users type their trips into the Discord channel by hand as they take
them, having already logged the same trip here. This posts it for them.

Scheduling, without a scheduler
-------------------------------
Trainlog is a request/response Flask app with no cron, no celery and no
gateway process, so the announcer is a daemon thread started at import time —
the same shape as the email listener. Two things make that safe under gunicorn,
where the thread runs in *every* worker:

* Before a trip is posted, a row is claimed with ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
  NOTHING RETURNING``. Exactly one worker gets the row back, and only that one
  calls Discord. Duplicate posts are therefore impossible however many workers
  run, and a restart mid-tick cannot repost.
* Only departures inside a short window are eligible, so an outage means a few
  missed posts rather than a flood of stale ones when the app comes back.

The window is matched on ``utc_start_datetime``, the only comparable clock
across users in different time zones; what gets *printed* is the trip's local
time, which is what the traveller would have typed themselves.
